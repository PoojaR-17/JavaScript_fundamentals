# JavaScript_fundamentals
Using ++/-- After the Operand
- When you use the increment/decrement operator after the operand, the value will
be returned before the operand is increased/decreased.
- In simple terms, Postpone the operation for later instead of it first printing it.
- This is known as Postfix Increment/Decrement.

- Explicit type conversion, also known as typecasting, is the manual conversion of a value from one data type to another. In JavaScript, this is done using built-in functions and methods, giving you full control over the conversion process.

- Type coercion in JavaScript is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another. This conversion can occur in various contexts, such as during arithmetic operations, logical operations, or when working with strings and booleans. Coercion makes JavaScript a very flexible language, but it can also lead to unexpected results if not properly understood.

- Type identification in JavaScript is about determining the data type of a given value. Whether it's a number, string, boolean, object, function, null, or undefined, type identification helps you understand how you can manipulate that value and predict how it will behave in different contexts.
